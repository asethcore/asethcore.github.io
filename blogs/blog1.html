        <p>hello folks, this is aseth, the sole owner of this webpage. to be honest, there's not much here—just some casual talks and a few things i like. truthfully, i have no solid reason for creating this page. the only explanation i give myself, just to justify its existence, is that i simply wanted to create something. or, to put it another way, i wanted to play around with <i>html</i> and <i>css</i>. now, this isn't my first time using <i>html</i> (though it is my first time tinkering with <i>css</i>). i've used <i>html</i> before to build something for someone, but i didn't quite achieve what i was aiming for.</p>
        <p>anyway, this page exists purely for experimental purposes, so i don’t expect anyone to discover it, let alone read my blogs. i’m not promoting it—no social media posts announcing my latest blog entries—because i’m not a social media guy, at least not anymore. and since it’s just an experimental project, i won’t be flooding it with blogs every week or month. honestly, i’m writing this while listening to <i>Bohemian Rhapsody<i> by Queen—one of my favorites.</p>
        <p>as for improving the website’s aesthetics, i probably won’t. i prefer things to be simple yet visually comfortable, and in its current state, it delivers what i want (though not so much on phones, so yeah, it’s not perfect). i’m also not the kind of person who enjoys tinkering with every little thing on the internet, so i won’t be making any further changes simply because i don’t feel like it.</p>
        <p>i have a wide range of interests, yet nothing in particular fascinates me for too long. what truly captivates me is the art of understanding things. when i come across something interesting, i have this urge to dive deep into it, to grasp its essence, and to experience it firsthand. that’s just how my mind works.</p>

        <p>now, about this website—it took me around five hours to put everything together. hosting it seemed like it would be a challenge, or at least that’s what i expected, but it turned out to be easier than i thought. of course, i had some help along the way. a dear friend of mine.</p>
        <p>and now, ending all this nonsensical yaddi yadda which no one’s gonna read, i have a final thing to say: i fluffing hate <i>css</i> with all my passion.</p>
