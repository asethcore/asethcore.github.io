        <h2>chaos cascade</h2>
        <p>
          this is one of my favourites in this i go through the chaos theory,
          chaos cascade, and yaa thats it i guess.

        <p>
          my second attempt at writing a blog, the first one i wrote looked more
          like some chaos caused by a child. however, i kind of figured it out.
          everything on paper seems childish, more like some nonsense an old man
          or a 9-year-old might talk about.
        </p>
        <p>
          putting all this in the trash can and coming to the topic i am here to
          write about: the chaos in the nature of the universe and how, once
          this chaos undergoes a chain reaction, it forms a ‘chaos cascade.’
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">
          understanding the nature of chaos
        </h2>
        <p>
          what i am talking about is this so-called unpredictability that
          catches us off guard many times, the unpredictability that might be
          caused by a certain unfold of events that don’t usually take place
          every day, these events or actions might seem very seamless, but they
          aren't. just like you and me, as humans, not everyone cares whether we
          exist or not. if either case were true, for them, it might still seem
          seamless, but in reality, it truly isn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          i might as well tell you about chaos theory, which also talks about
          this. giving a short history of this theory, it originated from the
          lorenz attractor, the face of Chaos Theory. So what’s the lorenz
          attractor? one fine day, a gentleman named Edward Lorenz was doing his
          usual study on the weather system. he used a set of equations related
          to atmospheric dynamics and experimented by slightly changing the
          initial values every time. every time he did so, he found something
          very intriguing, something he wasn’t expecting. he found chaos. he
          discovered that the outcomes of the equation differed vastly every
          time. to explain it using a figure of speech, imagine a butterfly
          flapping its wings in one part of the world, potentially causing a
          tornado or something very different somewhere else.
        </p>

          class="post-image"
        />
        <p>
          when plotted on a graph, the equation looked pretty beautiful. the
          solutions he found were known as the lorenz attractor, which kind of
          attracts chaos, and it’s the same way with our lives. maybe you give a
          lottery ticket to a beggar (which usually no one does), and who knows?
          The next day, he might be a millionaire or a billionaire. what this
          chaos suggests is that even a small deviation from the norm can cause
          something vastly different to happen. that’s what chaos theory is all
          about.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">the chaos cascade</h2>
        <p>
          now, when chaos keeps happening repeatedly over time, forming a chain
          reaction, it becomes the chaos cascade-or, say, the new normal. what
          we are living in right now is a chaos cascade, and to break this chaos
          cascade, we have to introduce another chaos. But the simplest irony is
          that if every chaos enters the chaos cascade, the chain reaction never
          stops. We never step out of this chaos cascade, and we never will.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          you see, chaos is not about bombarding anything until it looks like a
          mess. chaos is the subtle start of a change that is about to unravel.
          at first, it doesn’t look like a mess, but by the time we realize it,
          we are already a part of the ultimate chaos cascade without noticing
          it in the first place. we are surrounded by chaos, and the only way to
          break it is to cause another chaos. But it doesn’t go as we think, it
          acts like an endless equilibrium that never ends.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">the endless cycle of chaos</h2>
        <p>
          so now you know a little more than you usually do. but the real
          question is, can we ever escape chaos? the chaos might seem like a
          simple wave of wind, but it won’t take long to form a tornado and cage
          you within itself. perhaps every effort to break the chaos cascade
          just fuels another one, an infinite loop, an equilibrium that resets
          itself. maybe the key isn’t breaking it but understanding how to
          navigate it.
        </p>
        <p>see ya, folks. peace.</p>
