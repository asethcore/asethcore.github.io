          hello, my invisible folks! hope you're all doing great. anyway, i'm
          here lorem ipsum(brain.exe crashed) for a long time, but because the
          thought just struck me, and i figured it would be better to put it
          into words while it's fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          in this one, i wrote about the placebo effect or in general how the
          brain functions when perceiving reality.

          reality: a matter of perception
        </h2>
        <p>
          well you know how everyone have their own way of perceiving this so
          called reality. we all see the same thing(unless you are
          schizophrenic) but understand it differently that might be because of
          the pattern that our brain creates in order to process information,
          connecting dots, making predictions like an ai copilot. this is what
          makes up the term optimist or a pessimist.
        </p>
        <p>
          keeping this aside, have ye heard of the placebo effect? if not, let
          me explain. its basically the concept of beliefs replacing reality.
          point to be noticed that i said replacing not changing; there's a
          difference. no one can alter the objective reality, but belief can
          shift one's perspective of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          for example, imagine someone struggling to achieve something. when
          they fail, they might drop to their knees and pray(not always) if they
          later succeed, they say, "it happend because god wanted it to." but if
          they fail again, they may not say, "god wanted me to fail." that's
          because beliefs often works selectively; we accept what we want to
          believe in the moment.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">how placebo works</h2>
        <p>
          let me explain with an example, assume ther are two people one is
          superstitious and one is not one believes in science and one doesnt,
          so the overly logical and resonable person will often see things as
          consequence of different actions on the other hand the other might
          just classify it as fate (just an example its not really the case both
          know the consequences) so this is how placebo works beliefs replacing
          reality.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placebo/placebo.jpg" alt="placebo" class="post-image" />
        <p>
          this is essentially what the placebo effect does. you don't change
          what actually happend; instead, you shift your perception of it,
          convincing yourself that your version of reality is the one that
          matters.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">the reality that stays</h2>
        <p>
          even tho you can create a placebo for yourself, reality remains
          unchanged. what has happend cannot be undone, and what is about to
          happen will not bend to our wishes(murphy's law: "anything that can go
          wrong, will go wrong"). however, our perception is powerful. it shapes
          the way we react, make decisions, and even influences our emotions.
          but at its core, reality doesn't change only the way we choose to see
          it does. so in case you want to be happy but you dont have anything to
          be happy about just be delusional.
