        <p>mar 27, 2025</p>
        <p>hello, my crystal-clear people! hope everyone is doing great.</p>
        <p>
          so today, this fellow saint has come all the way down from the peak of
          a mountain named wisdom just to tell ye all, actually, share his
          opinion about life, what i think of it, what i don’t. and maybe a
          little bullshit from the right and some from the left. this blog might
          be named life or something, but it’s not just the living concept or
          something, it’s everything that makes up life.
        </p>
        <p>
          now this blog might feel very random at times, so yep, just letting ye
          know!
        </p>
        <img src="images/l/individual.jpeg" alt="individual" />
        <p>
          umm… finding the right way to start it… actually, let it be
          open-started.
        </p>
        <p>
          so, i think i understand life a little, not completely, only a little
          of it. but if someone asked me, “tell me what this life is about,” i
          might not be able to tell them. i wouldn’t be able to give a
          definition of it. and if i were asked whether i’m living my life on
          the same terms as i understand it, i’d still say no. and i guess it’s
          the same way with everyone, no one truly lives their life on the same
          terms they seem to understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          some beliefs i have: that each of us, at our core, is the same, you,
          me, everyone, hell, even einstein. we are nothing different. i can do
          all the same things that you can do and vice versa. the only
          difference is the way we do it. but where does this difference stem
          from? i believe it comes from the idea that everyone wants to be
          different. that is the root of this difference. and maybe that might
          be the unique thing… maybe. but really, there is nothing unique about
          it. like, if everyone has this unique thing, doesn’t it become a
          cliché?
        </p>
        <p>
          people, at their core, are too attached to their beliefs. they don’t
          want to abandon their belief just for some logic that could take away
          the comfort that particular belief brings to them. and also, that
          “people who believe without reason can’t be convinced by giving a
          reason.”
        </p>
        <p>
          now talking about love, some people preach about it as life is not
          complete without it. but let me tell you what i think. i dont know if
          i've ever truly been in love or not. i was definetly attracted to a
          girl i used to talk to-i still like her-but i'm not sure what
          qualifies something as "love." so honestly, i dont really know what
          love actually is. for me, maybe its just deep affection and care
          towards to someone. when one is in love-if i ever was or still am-one
          try to stand out, try to be different from the crowd, just for that
          person to notice, to become someone that person like.
        </p>
        <p>i don't know</p>
        <p>
          speaking from the other side, a person who isn't in love usually
          craves it. i guess everyone wants to be loved-who doesn't? or maybe
          it's not love itself, but just the assurance that someone is around
          and cares.
        </p>
        <p>
          as for me, i've kind of grown out of that desire-not completely, but
          to an extent. what i think is, it doesn't really matter. it's like
          this: if you never know what love was, you wouldn't long for it. you
          wouldn't care, or think, or talk about people you've never even met.
        </p>
        <p>
          i feel (just my opinion) that an experienced life is better than just
          a good life, an experienced life can be a good life, but a good life
          doesn’t necessarily mean an experienced one. i’m not saying you should
          experience everything, but you should experience life as much as you
          can. its just my opinion.
        </p>
        <img src="images/l/1.jpg" alt="good life" />
        <p>
          see, anyway, i am an absurd guy (oh, the irony), so the meaning of
          things doesn’t really matter to me. because at the end of life, if i’m
          not there, then what do meanings matter to me? i’m just a guy looking
          for peace, looking for chances to be amused by this absurdity of life.
          and i won’t lie, i’m having quite some time. but in between, i do
          become an existentialist who kinda gives a shit to some point. but
          beyond that, who are you, and who am i? it doesn’t really matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          yep, that was all in this empty head. will see you invisible folks
          later. till then, peace.
